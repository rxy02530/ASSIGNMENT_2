SVM produced better accuracy than the GaussianNB. When dealing with high-dimensional data, non-linear decision boundaries, or circumstances where outlier resilience is necessary, SVMs are frequently preferred. Contrarily, GaussianNB is a straightforward and effective approach that manages missing data, performs well with continuous features, and offers interpretability. SVM or GaussianNB should be selected based on the problem at hand, the type of data being used, and the trade-offs between model complexity and performance.
